# Gunpowder & Grimoires

**Gunpowder & Grimoires** is a dynamic top-down rogue-lite shooter set in a dark gunpowder fantasy world. As a lone monster hunter, you will navigate procedurally generated dungeons, fight grotesque creatures with magically enhanced firearms, and face challenging bosses to progress through ever-hardening levels.

This project was developed as a team assignment for a university course, utilizing the Godot Engine.
